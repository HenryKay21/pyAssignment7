# pyAssignment7

In this assignment we create a program which determines the final mark of a student derived from 3 sets of tests--Test 1, Test2 & coursework 
and a final test. Of the three sets of tests, only the best two are considered. The average of the best two is calculated by dividing by 2. 
That average is determined in percentage and then multiplied by 40. The final test result in percentage is calculated to be out of 60. The average mark
and final test mark are added to come up with the final mark! The name of the student and the best two marks of the student are written in a text file, plus the final test result and the total final mark. For a user to be able to access this information, they should first input the student's name. The program is be able 
to write in an excelsheet too.
